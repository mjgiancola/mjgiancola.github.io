## Welcome!
I am pursuing my PhD in Computer Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, where I am a Research Assistant in the [Rensselaer AI and Reasoning (RAIR) Lab](https://rair.cogsci.rpi.edu/). I recently graduated with a double Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Mathematical Sciences from Worcester Polytechnic Institute.

### Research Interests
I believe it is essential that AI agents are able to provide justification and verification for their actions/decisions. That is, AI agents should be able to justify their decisions and verify that the decision is correct, follows a moral/legal code, etc., (most likely) by providing a proof or argument.

To that end, my research interests include automated theorem proving, consistency-controlling logics, causal models, cognitive/neural architectures, and artificial general intelligence. My current research is focused on defeasible reasoning -- specifically, creating defeasible modal reasoners -- and uncertainty in modal logics.
