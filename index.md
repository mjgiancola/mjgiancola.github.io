## Welcome!
I'm a rising senior at Worcester Polytechnic Institute pursuing a double Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematical Sciences. After I graduate, I hope to either pursue a Ph.D in Computer Science or attain a research position in industry. My research interests include cognitive/neural architectures and transfer learning. My long-term goal is to contribute to the development of artificial general intelligence.

I'm currently working on a research project for IBM. I'm developing a novel method for 3D object detection and localization. Our method utilizes a single shot convolutional neural network to achieve very low latency. This makes it suitable for applications which require low latency like autonomous driving.

In the fall I will begin work on my Major Qualifying Project at WPI. I will be researching a method to determine variable-length string labels for video data from crowdsourced responses.
