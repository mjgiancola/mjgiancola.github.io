## Welcome!
I recently graduated with a double Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Mathematical Sciences from Worcester Polytechnic Institute. This summer I am working at Optie, where we are developing an AI driven platform to tailor the delivery of push notifications to each individual user. Starting this fall, I will be pursuing my PhD in Computer Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, where I plan to research logic-based AI.

### Research Interests
I'm interested in AI research that attempts to understand and model the human brain. I believe it is essential that AI is understandable and explainable (i.e. we can understand how it arrived at some decision and it can explain why it made some decision). To that end, my research interets include cognitive/neural architectures, brain-inspired AI, and AI alignment. My long-term goal is to contribute to the development of artificial general intelligence.

### Past Work

#### Permutation-Invariant Consensus over Crowdsourced Labels
I recently completed my Major Qualifying Project (MQP) at WPI. I developed a novel crowdsourcing consensus model and inference algorithm which is designed to recover the ground-truth labels of a dataset while being invariant to the class permutations enacted by the different annotators. This is particularly useful for settings in which annotators may have systematic confusions about the meanings of different classes, as well as clustering problems (e.g., dense pixel-wise image segmentation) in which the names/numbers assigned to each cluster have no inherent meaning.

My advisors - Randy Paffenroth and Jacob Whitehill - and I wrote a paper on our work called [Permutation-Invariant Consensus over Crowdsourced Labels](https://mjgiancola.github.io/papers/Giancola_Paffenroth_Whitehill_2018.pdf) which was accepted to [HCOMP 2018](https://www.humancomputation.com/2018/). This project also won the Provost's MQP Award for Mathematical Sciences in 2018.

#### IBM Research Internship
During the summer of 2017, I worked on a research project for IBM. I developed a novel method for 3D object detection and localization by adapting the [YOLO](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) framework to input RGB-D image frames and output 3D bounding boxes. Our method utilizes a single shot convolutional neural network and thus achieves very low latency. This makes it suitable for applications which require low latency like autonomous driving.
