## Welcome!
I'm a rising senior at Worcester Polytechnic Institute pursuing a double Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematical Sciences. After I graduate, I hope to either pursue a Ph.D in Computer Science or attain a research position in industry. My long-term goal is to contribute to the development of artificial general intelligence.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mjgiancola/mjgiancola.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
