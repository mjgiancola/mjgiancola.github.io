## Welcome!
I'm an AI Scientist at Charles River Analytics. Specifically, I'm a member of the NLP team within the Human-Centered AI (HAI) Division. My current work and research interests include formal representations (e.g., grammars, logics), natural language reasoning, and large-language models.

I earned my PhD in Computer Science and MS in Cognitive Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, advised by Prof. Selmer Bringsjord. Before that I earned my BS in Computer Science & Mathematical Sciences from Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
