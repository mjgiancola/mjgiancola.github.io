## Welcome!
I'm a senior at Worcester Polytechnic Institute pursuing a double Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematical Sciences. After I graduate, I hope to either pursue a Ph.D in Computer Science or attain a research position in industry. My research interests include cognitive/neural architectures, brain-inspired AI, and AI alignment. My long-term goal is to contribute to the development of artificial general intelligence.

This past summer I worked on a research project for IBM. I developed a novel method for 3D object detection and localization by adapting the [YOLO](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) framework to input RGB-D image frames and output 3D bounding boxes. Our method utilizes a single shot convolutional neural network and thus achieves very low latency. This makes it suitable for applications which require low latency like autonomous driving.

Currently I'm working on my Major Qualifying Project at WPI. I'm researching a method to determine variable-length string labels for video data from crowdsourced responses. Our major research question is, given a set of crowdsourced labels, can we recover not only the true labels, but also a style matrix which translates each labeler's style to the "canonical" style (eg. using an underscore in place of a dash).
