## Welcome!
I'm a senior at Worcester Polytechnic Institute pursuing a double Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematical Sciences. After I graduate, I hope to either pursue a Ph.D in Computer Science or attain a research position in industry. My research interests include cognitive/neural architectures, brain-inspired AI, and AI alignment. My long-term goal is to contribute to the development of artificial general intelligence.

This past summer I worked on a research project for IBM. I developed a novel method for 3D object detection and localization by adapting the [YOLO](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) framework to input RGB-D image frames and output 3D bounding boxes. Our method utilizes a single shot convolutional neural network and thus achieves very low latency. This makes it suitable for applications which require low latency like autonomous driving.

Currently I'm working on my Major Qualifying Project at WPI. I'm developing a new crowdsourcing consensus model for recovering labels of clusters. We consider the possibility that labelers may have *systematic* misunderstandings about the data they are labeling ie. someone always labels category A as category B. We show that it is possible to recover ground truth labels and a *style matrix* for each labeler -- a bistochastic matrix whose entries give the probability that a labeler perceives some label and transcribes another (ie. they perceive the correct category 'A' but transcribe 'B').

We show that our model can be used to improve image segmentation datasets. Specifically, given several 'noisy' segmentations of the same image, our model can recover a better segmentation.
