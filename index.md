## Welcome!
I'm a rising senior at Worcester Polytechnic Institute pursuing a double Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematical Sciences. After I graduate, I hope to either pursue a Ph.D in Computer Science or attain a research position in industry. My research interests include cognitive/neural architectures and transfer learning. My long-term goal is to contribute to the development of artificial general intelligence.
