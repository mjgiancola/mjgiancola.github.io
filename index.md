## Welcome!
I am pursuing my PhD in Computer Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, where I am a Research Assistant in the [Rensselaer AI and Reasoning (RAIR) Lab](https://rair.cogsci.rpi.edu/). I recently graduated with a double Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Mathematical Sciences from Worcester Polytechnic Institute.

This summer, I'm working as an Applied Scientist Intern in the Automated Reasoning Group at Amazon Web Services (AWS). There I'm working on using machine learning to predict the runtime of SMT solvers.

### Research Interests
I believe it is essential that AI agents are able to provide justification and verification for their actions/decisions. That is, AI agents should be able to justify their decisions and verify that the decision is correct, follows a moral/legal code, etc., (most likely) by providing a proof or argument.

To that end, my research interests include automated reasoning, reasoning under uncertainty, and artificial general intelligence. My current research is focused on uncertainty _qualification_ (as contrasted with uncertainty quantification). That is, I'm interested in creating AI agents which can qualify the uncertainty of their beliefs in a cognitively-plausible way (e.g. "I believe it is overwhelmingly likely that formula phi holds."), and update their beliefs when they receive new information (which may be inconsistent with prior beliefs).
