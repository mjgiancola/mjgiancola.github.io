## Welcome!
I'm a senior at Worcester Polytechnic Institute pursuing a double Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematical Sciences. After I graduate, I hope to either pursue a Ph.D in Computer Science or attain a research position in industry. My research interests include cognitive/neural architectures, brain-inspired AI, and AI alignment. My long-term goal is to contribute to the development of artificial general intelligence.

This past summer I worked on a research project for IBM. I developed a novel method for 3D object detection and localization by adapting the [YOLO](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) framework to input RGB-D image frames and output 3D bounding boxes. Our method utilizes a single shot convolutional neural network and thus achieves very low latency. This makes it suitable for applications which require low latency like autonomous driving.

Currently I'm working on my Major Qualifying Project at WPI. I'm developing a crowdsourcing consensus algorithm which considers how each labeler's perception of the true label may differ from how they translate that perception into their label. To do this, we model a bistochastic "style" matrix for each labeler, where the ij'th entry of the matrix gives the probability that the labeler perceives label i but responds with label j.
